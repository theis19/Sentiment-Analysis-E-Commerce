# Sentiment-Analysis-E-Commerce
This Repository is made to store my final project as a requirement to graduate from Data Science Job Connector Program at Purwadhika Digital Technology School.

## Project Description
This is a dataset of [Women's Clothing E-Commerce](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews) that revolves around the reviews written by customers. In this project, the author tries to put himself in the E-Commerce owner's position where as the owner, he needs to understand and gain insight of the store sales, and one way to do that is by gaining it through customer's reviews. Aside from gaining insight, the author will also try to make a model to learn sentiments from the review's data. The model could then predict review's sentiment, whether Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
